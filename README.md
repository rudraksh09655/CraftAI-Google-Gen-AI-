## 1. The Problem
Indian artisans, rich in cultural heritage and traditional skills, often face significant challenges in the modern digital marketplace. A lack of digital marketing expertise, limited resources, and the difficulty of bridging traditional craftsmanship with contemporary consumer trends severely restrict their market reach and profitability. This creates a disconnect that threatens the sustainability of these vital art forms.

## 2. Our Solution: CraftAI
CraftAI is the bridge that closes the gap between traditional craftsmanship and the modern digital market. It is not another marketplace; it's an empowerment engine‚Äîa new class of tool that acts as a personal AI co-pilot for Indian artisans.

Our platform provides a simple, intuitive workspace where an artisan can upload a photo of their craft and Describe it in a few simple words.
